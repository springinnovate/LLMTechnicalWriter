Will partnerships benefit all project participants, including pathways for cross-training students and other researchers in the methods to be pursued?\n- Funding for 2 postdocs, fundings for 2 early career researchers, new partnerships across disciplines, advancement of career goals for all partnerships\n\n\nInitial project plan\n\nBackground:\nUnderstanding how we can ‘naturally’ control agricultural pests is a key sustainability question in food production systems. Many concentrated studies have found evidence that preservation of natural areas and natural resources should conserve and support biological control agents, such as birds and insect predators (Emery et al. 2024; Bowler et al. 2019; Martin et al. 2019; Rollan et al. 2019; Frischkoff et al. 2014). However, these questions typically produce much more complicated results when broadened across pests, plants and the globe: for example, field size, edge density, phenology and species’ traits have produced much more complex stories (Tscharntke et al. 2016; Karp et al. 2018; Tamburini et al. 2020; Alexandridis et al. 2021). Therefore, at a global scale, previous studies have found few, if any, patterns that broadly predict whether agricultural pests would be successful.\n\nWith leaps in remote-sensing data products that observe and describe variation in landscapes and climate across the world, we have renewed power to interrogate previous studies which found complex results. Additionally, over the past several years, agricultural studies, insect trait, phenological information, phylogenies of insects and plant trait databases have been published (Fernandez et al. 2021; Radeloff et al. 2019; Tamburini et al. 2020). By combining multiple data types, including climate data, pest trait data, and landscape data at a high resolution, we are interested in understanding whether there are any take-home messages in this story, to help illuminate when biological control of pests will be effective.\n\nGiven the massive potential power of biological and remote sensing data distributed globally, we will apply an AI intensive approach to the question of agricultural pests: which aspects of the environment and traits of the pests are most important to predicting global prevalence of dominant agricultural pests?\n\nUnderstanding whether there are shared dynamics in agricultural areas globally, will help practitioners better understand what aspects may be most important to control or mitigate to further biological control in their own area. However, given that different farms operate in vastly different ecosystems with contrasts in landscape, climate and communities, there may be regional best predictors of pests. Therefore, we also intend to find the most important predictors of variation in outbreaks shared within and across regions of the globe. Combining a global and regional scale approach will better illuminate why there is so much variation in the success of biological control of agricultural pests across contexts.\n\nNotably, this study will introduce several inherently temporal contexts of these dynamics. Understanding the stability or stochasticity of the environment over time, and comparing those measures across many different farms, studies and global locations, may help us understand the deeper context to agricultural pests. For example, locations throughout the globe have experienced varying degrees of stochasticity in their climate, and climate change itself with rising temperatures, changing weather phenology, increasing numbers of extreme events or changing precipitation patterns over the past century. Comparing sites through this lens will illuminate the importance not only of the climate that animal and plant players experienced directly, but their populations at a broader timescale.\n\nThese agricultural landscapes and their communities have also changed considerably at various locations, and may have also experienced changes in agricultural intensity, practice and landscape heterogeneity over a similar time period, while other areas have not. By introducing not only climate normal and anomaly data, but also landscape normals and anomalies, we intend to better represent the historical and evolutionary background of a given system. The history of the landscape and greater environment may have a bigger story to tell, and also help us predict where biocontrol of insect pests may work better, given both a spatial and temporal (eco-evolutionary) lens. This lens will add to both the global and regional understanding of how biological control impacts pests.\n\nGiven that the history of the landscape may have historical significance in understanding and predicting pest pressure, it is also key to understand how the relationships between pest species and their evolutionary history may predict their prevalence and connect with the traits that allow pests to be successful in a given crop in a given place at a given time.\n\nBy investigating first which predictors of variation in pest success are most relevant at meso and global scales, we will harness this database’s ability to understand ‘what matters’. We then will follow up on a deeper investigation of why these predictors matter, incorporating temporal data, to understand where, why and how risks to agriculture globally vary.\n\nQuestion: How does variation in climate, pest evolutionary ecology and landscapes help predict when pests are most prevalent across the globe using AI-driven methods?\n\nData:\n- Database of many short field studies (experimental and observational) with pest pressure on a variety of agricultural products throughout the world.\n\nParameters of Question:\n- Variation in climate\n  - Level of stochasticity, variation in stochasticity\n  - Change in climate, heteroscedasticity\n  - Biome/Ecotype/Lat.Lon.\n- Variation in landscape\n  - Amount contiguous agriculture\n  - Heterogeneity\n  - Change in composition over space\n  - Change in composition over time\n  - Diversity\n  - Productivity/Health\n- Variation in pests and their communities\n  - Pest identity and traits\n  - Predator identity and traits\n  - Plant identity\n  - Pest phylogeny and relationships\n\nData-linked Questions:\n- Database-wide derived measures of pest responses to environmental variation\n- Derive most important variables to predict suppression: What variation in the environment is important to predicting variation in pest suppression?\n  - Run a decision tree method to understand which environmental variables are most predictive of successful biological control of pests and of low pest abundance.\n  - Broken down into regions and also run globally\n- Explain how variation in the environment affects pest suppression: How does variation in the environment predict whether pest suppression, and more specifically biological control of pests, is successful?\n  - Regression analysis testing if in areas where the landscape and climate has been more stable, if biological control of pests has been more successful.\n  - More specifically, is biocontrol of native pests more successful in stable areas than stochastic areas?\n  - Is biocontrol of low dispersing pests more successful in stable areas than stochastic areas?\n  - Is biocontrol of generalist pests more successful in stable areas than biocontrol of specialist pests in stable areas, particularly when compared to stochastic equivalents?\n\nMethods Summary:\n- What environmental variants and pest traits predict better biological control?\n  - RF/PCA/PLS/NMDS\n  - Comparison: What are the globally shared predictors of biological control across the globe?\n  - Product: Concluded best environmental and trait predictors of pest suppression and biological control, and in what way they predict these outcomes.\n  - Which predictors are more important in which areas, and which ones are consistently important, at a meso-scale and a global scale.\n- How do we expect the success of biological control to vary across the environment?\n  - GLMM\n  - Product: How environmental stability relates to the success of biological control across the globe given the differences in pest communities.\n  - Communities vary in the level of land use change and experiences of climate change, in addition to differences in human and natural community make up.\n\n∴ Given [changing and variable climates], [changing and variable landscapes], and [diversity of plant-insect interactions], we have varied outcomes of biological pest control in agricultural landscapes.\n\nProject Outline:\n- Question: can data on the bugs of the past predict the pests of the future?\n  - Can we predict when pests have significant impacts — e.g., high abundance, having significant crop impacts, or not being kept in check by natural enemies?\n  - Must focus on leps because of phylogenetic data issues, but this isn’t necessarily a huge minus\n  - Leps are charismatic for conservation BI\n  - Leps contribute to some of the worst pest pressure (e.g., corn borer) for application/econ BI\n\nPhase 1: Data aggregation\n- Data inputs:\n  - Database of pest observations in the field, other community members (including predators), crop info, and landscape info\n  - Community science data for presence/absence\n  - In-progress trait dataset: dispersal, diet breadth, habitat breadth, body size, invasiveness status, thermal traits, etc.\n  - Earth observation data: climate, land cover, texture, etc.\n  - Phylogeny of pests\n  - Use of AI to fill gaps when appropriate (NLP to fill trait database, ML to fill in observations x EO predictors, AI to help fill in phylogeny)\n  - Creation and filling out of phylogenies (focus on moths)\n  - Possibly pilot in one or a few taxa with a well-resolved phylogeny, like Lepidoptera\n\nPhase 2: Test/ask how everything we know explains pest abundances now/or trends in the past using typical methods\n- Frequentist:\n  - pest abundance ~ field info + traits * phylo + climate + lulc + (1|space + 1|study, etc.)\n  - Δ pest ~ field info + traits * phylo + climate + lulc + time + (1|space + 1|study, etc.)\n  - Δ pest ~ field info + traits * phylo + climate + lulc + space + (1|study, etc.)\n- AI/ML approaches:\n  - Traditional ML: (Convolutional) Neural Nets, SVM/SVR for spatial and temporal patterns\n  - Knowledge-guided machine learning (KGML) for accuracy/interpretability\n  - Possibly spatial transformers or foundational spatial models (PRITHVI)\n\nPhase 3: Ask how we think pest pressure will change or be greatest in the future given what we have gathered in phase 1 and learned from phase 2\n- Harness “the machine”\n- Compare to more typical statistical models (CRM uses frequentist; MEB uses Bayesian)\n- Novel AI methods to iteratively train and predict how past info predicts future pest pressure\n- Compare KGML, frequentist/traditional methods vs. ML methods\n- Leverage time-series/spatial coverage for cross-validation\n\nDisciplinary team members we need\n- Definitely needed:\n  -
