In answering all questions do not make up any information, provide direct truthful statements, do not elaborate or write flowery language. For each section you write, if relevant, make sure it tries to meet these program description requirements: 1) Geosciences Advancement: How do the proposed activities contribute to advancing geosciences research and/or education in response to motivating science drivers? 2) AI Impact: What novel integration of AI is proposed, and does it overcome significant methodological and/or capacity bottlenecks that inhibit research progress in the geosciences? Partnerships: Does the proposal include mechanisms to develop meaningful interdisciplinary partnerships to support the intended Geosciences Advancement and AI Impact? Will partnerships benefit all project participants, including pathways for cross-training students and other researchers in the methods to be pursued?"
